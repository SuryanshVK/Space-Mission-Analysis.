# Space-Mission-Analysis.

n end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project uncovering trends, performance, and insights from global space missions.

📌 Overview
With the rising interest in space exploration, this project dives deep into a dataset of global space launches to answer key questions:

🌍 Who’s leading the space race — countries or private players?
🔁 Are reused rockets like those by SpaceX actually reliable?
💰 Do higher mission costs lead to more success?
📈 How has launch frequency and success evolved over the years?
🧹 Data & Process
Cleaned raw space mission data (missing values, formatting, type conversions)
Conducted EDA using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
Visualized trends in launch outcomes, cost efficiency, mission types, and more
🔍 Key Insights
🇺🇸 USA and 🇷🇺 Russia dominate, but private firms like SpaceX are rapidly gaining ground
🔁 Reused rockets show high success rates — innovation is paying off
💸 Rocket Lab offers the lowest cost per successful launch (~$7.5M)
🚀 Launches surged post-2015, driven by commercial advancements
🏛️ Government missions still lead in volume, but private launches have higher success rates

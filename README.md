# Space Mission Analysis

# 🚀 Space Mission Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview
With the growing global interest in space exploration, this project performs an **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on worldwide space mission data.  
The goal is to uncover meaningful trends, performance patterns, and insights related to **launch success   , cost efficiency, and the evolving role of private players** in the space industry.

This analysis answers key questions such as:
- 🌍 Who is leading the space race — governments or private companies?
- 🔁 Are reused rockets (like those by SpaceX) reliable?
- 💰 Does higher mission cost guarantee higher success?
- 📈 How have launch frequency and success rates evolved over time?

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing
The raw dataset underwent extensive preprocessing:
- Handling missing and null values
- Standardizing formats and correcting data types
- Filtering and transforming data for analysis readiness

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed using Python to analyze:
- Launch trends over time
- Mission success vs failure rates
- Cost efficiency of different organizations
- Comparison between government and private launches
- Impact of reusable rockets on mission success

Visualizations were created to clearly represent patterns and insights.
